C++ samples
===========

The C++ samples demonstrate ONNX Runtime's V2 device-based execution provider
APIs with the TensorRT RTX Execution Provider. They share the ``candy.onnx``
neural-style-transfer model and ``Input.png`` test image unless noted otherwise.

Available samples
-----------------

``10_ep-device-selection``
   Registers execution provider libraries, enumerates available EP devices, and
   selects a device explicitly or through an ONNX Runtime selection policy.
   The executable is ``ep-device-selection``.

``20_devicetensors-datatransfer``
   Allocates EP-agnostic device tensors, transfers them with ``CopyTensors``,
   and uses I/O binding to avoid repeated transfers during inference. The
   executable is ``devicetensors-datatransfer``.

``21_devicetensors-datatransfer-async``
   Uses EP-provided pinned and device-memory allocators, asynchronous
   ``CopyTensors`` operations, sync notifications, and non-synchronizing run
   submissions. The executable is ``devicetensors-datatransfer-async``.

``30_syncstreams-cuda``
   Demonstrates CUDA interoperability with ONNX Runtime ``SyncStream`` and
   ``SyncNotification`` objects across separate upload and inference streams.
   This target is built only when CMake finds the CUDA Toolkit. The executable
   is ``syncstreams_cuda``.

``40_ep-context``
   Precompiles models into reusable TensorRT RTX EP Context models. ``sample``
   covers file-based embedded and external context modes; ``sample_buffer``
   covers in-memory models with external initializer data.

Build and run
-------------

Enable the samples while configuring the main project:

.. code-block:: text

   -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON

Then build normally as described in the :doc:`build-guide`. CMake downloads
``candy.onnx`` and copies the common input image and required runtime libraries
to the sample output directories.

The sample executables are created below ``build/examples/cxx``. Visual Studio
and other multi-configuration generators add a configuration directory such as
``Release``. Each sample directory contains a README with its command-line
arguments and additional implementation details.

The samples run inference on an NVIDIA GPU. Their CTest registrations may
therefore fail on systems without a compatible GPU or runtime driver.
